# Reporting for WinForms - Print Multiple Reports in a Batch

In this example, the reports are printed in a single batch, instead of sending one report at a time to the printer. The **Print** dialog box is only called for the first report, the other reports are printed without prompting, with the same print settings. 
 

The [PrintTool.Printdialog](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.PrintTool.PrintDialog.overloads) method is used to print the reports. The [StartPrint](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.PrintingSystemBase.StartPrint) event is handled to specify print settings.
